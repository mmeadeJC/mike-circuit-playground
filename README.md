# Circuit Playground

A Storybook-based sandbox for experimenting with the **JumpCloud Circuit Design System**, prototyping pages with real code, and leveraging the **Figma MCP server** in Cursor to translate designs into production-quality Vue components.

## What This Repo Is For

1. **Circuit DS exploration** — Browse and interact with every Circuit DS and PrimeVue component through isolated Storybook stories (`src/stories/circuit-ds/`).
2. **Figma-to-code with Cursor** — Use the Figma MCP server integration in Cursor to pull design context, tokens, and Code Connect mappings directly from Figma into your code. Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules/` enforce that all generated UI code uses Circuit tokens and components.
3. **Prototyping with real code** — Build full-page prototypes under `src/stories/projects/` using actual Circuit components, PrimeVue primitives, and mock data. These prototypes run in Storybook and behave like real application screens.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Vue 3 |
| Design system | `@jumpcloud/circuit` + `@jumpcloud/icons` |
| UI primitives | PrimeVue 4 (styled via Circuit passthrough) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 with Circuit preset |
| Component dev | Storybook 8 |
| Build | Vite 6 |
| AI tooling | Cursor with Figma MCP server |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **npm** >= 9
- Access to the `@jumpcloud` npm registry (for `@jumpcloud/circuit` and `@jumpcloud/icons`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd circuit-playground

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

> If you hit authentication errors during install, make sure your `.npmrc` is configured with the correct registry and token for the `@jumpcloud` scope.

### Running Storybook

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This starts Storybook on **http://localhost:6006**. You can browse:

- **Circuit DS** — Individual component stories showcasing props, variants, and theming.
- **Projects** — Full-page prototypes (e.g. Asset Management pages) with mock data and navigation.

Use the theme switcher in the Storybook toolbar to toggle between **Light** and **Dark** Circuit themes.

## Working with Figma + Cursor

This repo is set up to work with the **Figma MCP server** in Cursor:

1. **Select a Figma node** in the Figma desktop app.
2. **Ask Cursor to implement it** — Cursor will use Code Connect to find the right Circuit component, pull design tokens, and generate Vue code that follows the design system rules.
3. **Cursor rules** (`.cursor/rules/circuit-design-system.mdc`) enforce that all generated code uses Circuit typography tokens, color tokens, and existing components — no hardcoded values or duplicate components.

## Adding a New Prototype Page

1. Create a new folder under `src/stories/projects/<your-project>/pages/`.
2. Create a `*.stories.ts` file with your page story.
3. Use Circuit components and PrimeVue primitives for all UI.
4. Add mock data in a `mock-data/` folder if needed.
5. Run Storybook to see your page live.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run storybook` | Start Storybook dev server on port 6006 |
| `npm run build-storybook` | Build static Storybook for deployment |
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
